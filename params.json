{"name":"bcstack.org","tagline":"An embedded, royalty-free, lightweight Bluetooth SMART software stack","body":"# About\r\nThe aim of bcstack.org is to create royalty-free software that can be used to make Bluetooth SMART products. Its core is an ultra lightweight Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) single mode stack.\r\n\r\n# License\r\nbcstack is available under Apache V2 license. It can be used freely in commercial products.\r\n\r\n# Supported Platforms\r\nbcstack works on linux with a 4.0 USB Bluetooth Dongle but it is designed to work on microcontrollers.\r\n\r\n# Why we are doing this?\r\nWe see most (if not all) bluetooth le stacks are not open sourced so we cannot touch its internals and hack it for fun, so we started to develop an open source stack.\r\n\r\n# How to help\r\nIf you are also interested in developing an open source bluetooth smart stack, join us and help.\r\nYou may:\r\n* spread the idea and help to find more people to join\r\n* hack the code and help us to improve it\r\n* tell us your interesting ideas\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\n# Join Us\r\n* QQ discussion group 294146623.\r\n* My email is junfenggeng AT gmail DOT com\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/bcstack/bcstack/wiki)\r\n[bcsphere](http://www.bcsphere.net/portal.php)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
